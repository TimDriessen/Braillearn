# Braillearn

Currently, this is a demo of the features the final product will have and is meant to run on a PC. This repository will be expanded as the project progresses and the software is changed.
To run it, Python 3.7 and the pyttsx3 package are necessary. Executing the full program requires running '\_\_main\_\_.py'.

This code demonstrates the progess so far with regards to text-to-speech that is needed for the final product, combining multiple files
to keep the program structure clear and for ease of editing, as well as accessing files dynamically such that later on the exercises of different difficulty levels can be edited, added to or removed from without the need to rewrite the main program.

It also show a small demo of how the system will work: it asks to enter the braille symbol for a letter, the numbers 1-6 represent the six braille dots, the 'n' key can be pressed to confirm and 'p' to reset.


The braille dots are numbered 1-6 as shown below.
